        "text": "Do you know what leads you to feel stress? Odds are that at least one cause <br> (and probably more than one) entered your mind. But if I were to ask you about <br> the stress that the people in your social world feel, would it occur to you as a <br> factor in your own stress? Perhaps it would, depending on your circumstances.<br> But probably not. And yet, this is exactly what a group of researchers decided to <br> investigate. They cited research that stress is conveyed between two people or <br> among a more limited group of folks.<br><br> In this longitudinal study, they tracked the stress of a large group of <br> graduate students over the course of six months. The investigators measured <br> various aspects of people's lives, including their degree of stress along with <br>three different personality attributes. Specifically, they asked about people's <br> neuroticism (a tendency to feel more upset and have more fluctuations in how <br> they feel), their conscientiousness (an inclination to engage in self-control <br> and careful consideration, and to think ahead and come up with solutions to <br> problems), and their locus of control (how much someone views themselves or events around them as determining the result of a situation).<br><br> The researchers found that the stress an individual experienced was <br> connected to the extent of stress in their social world, and that certain factors <br> appeared to play a role. First, they found that a person's stress was more apt to <br> fall in line with the stress of those in their social sphere when the stress among <br> the people in that sphere was comparable (as opposed to more diverse).<br> Second, they found that there was a weaker tie between a person's stress and <br> the magnitude of stress in their social life if that person had a less neuroticism,<br> more conscientiousness, and an internal locus of control.<br><br> Although the research team noted that it's not entirely clear why the stress <br> in a person's social world is linked to their own stress, they highlighted two <br> possibilities. One is that humans tend to draw from others' reactions to try to <br> grasp a situation better. Another is that we tend to observe how other people <br> are responding to help us calibrate the most suitable way of reacting so we <br> can socially fit in. As the researchers rightly pointed out, the study merits being <br> repeated to understand whether the results apply to different groups of people, <br> such as individuals who are older (the average age in this study was 28). <br><br> Despite the lingering questions this study couldn't address, the researchers <br> noted that people who feel more stress are likely to connect with others who <br> have the same stress level, and then they feel more stress as they socially engage <br> with those who are also feeling a lot of stress. Accordingly, the research team <br> mentioned the potential value of future programs that could help people learn <br> new coping strategies to reduce the odds of stress being transferred, as well as <br> programs that could enable people with different stress levels to connect.<br><br><br><br> (Sumber: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article)",

        "text": "The next few decades will see great changes in the way energy is supplied <br> and used. In some major oil producing nations, ‘peak oil' has already been <br> reached, and there are increasing fears of global warming. Consequently, many <br> countries are focusing on the switch to a low carbon economy. This transition <br> will lead to major changes in the supply and use of electricity. Firstly, there <br> will be an increase in overall demand, as consumers switch from oil and gas <br> to electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Secondly, there will be an <br> increase in power generation, not only in terms of how much is generated, <br> but also how it is generated, as there is growing electricity generation from <br> renewable sources. There is also likely more electricity generation centres, as <br> households and communities take up the opportunity to install photovoltaic <br> cells and small scale wind turbines. To meet these challenges, countries are <br> investing in Smart Grid technology. This system aims to provide the electricity <br> industry with a better understanding of power generation and demand, and to <br> use this information to create a more efficient power network. <br><br> Smart Grid technology basically involves the application of a computer <br> system to the electricity network thus it will pitch in reducing operational <br> and maintenance costs. Smart Grid technology offers benefits to the consumer too. <br> They will be able to collect real-time information on their energy use for each <br> appliance. Varying tariffs throughout the day will give customers the incentive <br> to use appliances at times when supply greatly exceeds demand, leading to <br> great reductions in bills. For example, they may use their washing machines at <br> night. Smart meters can also be connected to the internet or telephone system, <br> allowing customers to switch appliances on or off remotely. Furthermore, if <br> houses are fitted with the apparatus to generate their own power, appliances <br> can be set to run directly from the on-site power source, and any excess can be <br> sold to the grid. <br><br>With these changes comes a range of challenges. The first involves <br> managing the supply and demand. Sources of renewable energy, such as wind, <br> wave and solar, are notoriously unpredictable, and nuclear power, which is <br> also set to increase as nations switch to alternative energy sources, is inflexible. <br> With oil and gas, it is relatively simple to increase the supply of energy to match <br> the increasing demand during peak times of the day or year. With alternative <br> sources, this is far more difficult, and may lead to blackouts or system collapse. <br> Potential solutions include investigating new and efficient ways to store energy <br> and encouraging consumers to use electricity at off-peak times. <br><br> A second problem is the fact that many renewable power generation <br> sources are located in remote areas, such as windy uplands and coastal regions, <br> where there is currently a lack of electrical infrastructure. New infrastructures <br> therefore must be built. Thankfully, with improved smart technology, this can <br> be done more efficiently by reducing the reinforcement or construction costs.<br><br>Although Smart Technology is still in its infancy, pilot schemes to promote <br> and test it are already underway. Consumers are currently testing the new <br> smart meters which can be used in their homes to manage electricity use. <br> There are also a number of demonstrations being planned to show how the <br> smart technology could practically work, and trials are in place to test the new <br> electrical infrastructure. It is likely that technology will be added in ‘layers', <br> starting with ‘quick win' methods which will provide initial carbon savings, to be <br> followed by more advanced systems at a later date. Cities are prime candidates <br> for investment into smart energy, due to the high population density and <br> high energy use. It is here where Smart Technology is likely to be promoted <br> first, utilising a range of sustainable power sources, transport solutions and an <br> infrastructure for charging electrically powered vehicles. The infrastructure is <br> already changing fast. By the year 2050, changes in the energy supply will have <br> transformed our homes, our roads and our behaviour. <br><br><br><br> (Sumber: https://www.examenglish.com/)",

        "text": "Bicycles have been around since the early part of the nineteenth century. <br> In 1817 Karl Von Drais invented a walking machine to get around the royal <br> gardens faster. Made entirely of wood, the rider straddled two same-sized, in <br> line wheels, steering with the front wheel and locomoting by pushing against <br> the ground. This steerable hobby horse, which could surpass runners and horse <br> drawn carriages, never became a viable transportation option because of the <br> need for smooth pathways, which were rare at that time. <br><br> A second major effort at self-propelled transportation came when Pierre <br> Michaux invented in 1861 the velocipede ('fast foot') that applied pedals <br> directly to the front wheel. To achieve greater speed with every pedal revolution, <br> designers tried larger and larger front wheels, with some reaching almost two <br> meters in diameter. Despite garnering interest from hobbyists, the velocipede <br> had three major deficiencies as transportation: First, lacking gears, it was difficult <br> to climb even a modest grade; second, because the construction was entirely of <br> wood, with metal tires coming slightly later, the cobblestone roads of the day <br> made for an extremely uncomfortable ride; third, the big front wheel created <br> problems. <br><br> A fresh start and the true beginning of bicycles becoming a popular means <br> of transportation can be traced to around 1886 and the efforts of John Kemp <br> Starley and William Sutton. With equal-sized wheels, tubular steel diamond- <br> shaped frame geometry, and a chain-and-sprocket chain drive to the rear <br> wheel, the 'safety bike' looked much like the modern version. During the late <br> 1890s, bicycles were the worldwide focus of invention and technical innovation, <br> much as biotech engineering and computers are today. We owe many of today's <br> industrial manufacturing processes, designs for bearings, axles, and gearing <br> mechanisms, and the knowledge of lightweight structures, to the explosion of <br> inventions that bicycles produced. <br><br> In the United States, England, and other major nations, patents were <br> awarded at the rate of about 5,000 per year per nation. In one peak year, bicycle- <br> related patents comprised close to one-third of all patent-writing activity. Many <br> of these patents were decades ahead of the technology to manufacture them; <br> for example, suspension systems invented a century ago became viable only <br> with modern-day elastic materials and manufacturing technology. <br><br>The two most important single inventions of this long-ago era were <br> Starley's tension-spooked wheel and John Dunlop's pneumatic tire. The <br> tension-spooked wheel was and is a marvel of lightweight structures; it allows <br> four ounces of spokes, on a wheel weighing a total of three or four pounds, to <br> support a 200-pound rider meanwhile today's carbon fiber wheels have yet to <br> show a clear advantage over the wheel made from humble carbon steel spokes. <br> The pneumatic tire, which Dunlop invented in 1888, vastly improved the bike's <br> comfort, and it also shielded the lightweight working mechanisms from excess <br> vibration and fatigue. The coaster brake appeared in 1889, and it has been a <br> staple of children's bikes ever since. <br><br> Because a bicycle uses a low-power engine (the rider) and because that <br> rider can only apply power only over a small rpm range, gearing is essential <br> to match the rider's output to the riding conditions. The first patent for bicycle <br> gears was granted in France in 1868; the rider pedaled forward for one gear and <br> backward for the other gear. An 1869 patent by France's Barberon and Meunier <br> foresaw today's derailleurs. It described a mechanism that would shift a belt <br> or chain sideways among three sprockets or discs. That same year, Barberon <br> and Meunier also patented a primitive gear hub. These technical innovations <br> dramatically improved performance. Bicycles of that era were hand-made in <br> cottage industries, and were highly sought after and expensive. <br><br><br> <br> (Sumber: https: //www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/technology/technology terms-and-concepts/bicycle)",
