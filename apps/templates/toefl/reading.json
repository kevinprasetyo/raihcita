        "text": "Do you know what leads you to feel stress? Odds are that at least one cause <br> (and probably more than one) entered your mind. But if I were to ask you about <br> the stress that the people in your social world feel, would it occur to you as a <br> factor in your own stress? Perhaps it would, depending on your circumstances.<br> But probably not. And yet, this is exactly what a group of researchers decided to <br> investigate. They cited research that stress is conveyed between two people or <br> among a more limited group of folks.<br><br> In this longitudinal study, they tracked the stress of a large group of <br> graduate students over the course of six months. The investigators measured <br> various aspects of people's lives, including their degree of stress along with <br>three different personality attributes. Specifically, they asked about people's <br> neuroticism (a tendency to feel more upset and have more fluctuations in how <br> they feel), their conscientiousness (an inclination to engage in self-control <br> and careful consideration, and to think ahead and come up with solutions to <br> problems), and their locus of control (how much someone views themselves <br> or events around them as determining the result of a situation).<br><br> The researchers found that the stress an individual experienced was <br> connected to the extent of stress in their social world, and that certain factors <br> appeared to play a role. First, they found that a person's stress was more apt to <br> fall in line with the stress of those in their social sphere when the stress among <br> the people in that sphere was comparable (as opposed to more diverse).<br> Second, they found that there was a weaker tie between a person's stress and <br> the magnitude of stress in their social life if that person had a less neuroticism,<br> more conscientiousness, and an internal locus of control.<br><br> Although the research team noted that it's not entirely clear why the stress <br> in a person's social world is linked to their own stress, they highlighted two <br> possibilities. One is that humans tend to draw from others' reactions to try to <br> grasp a situation better. Another is that we tend to observe how other people <br> are responding to help us calibrate the most suitable way of reacting so we <br> can socially fit in. As the researchers rightly pointed out, the study merits being <br> repeated to understand whether the results apply to different groups of people, <br> such as individuals who are older (the average age in this study was 28). <br><br> Despite the lingering questions this study couldn't address, the researchers <br> noted that people who feel more stress are likely to connect with others who <br> have the same stress level, and then they feel more stress as they socially engage <br> with those who are also feeling a lot of stress. Accordingly, the research team <br> mentioned the potential value of future programs that could help people learn <br> new coping strategies to reduce the odds of stress being transferred, as well as <br> programs that could enable people with different stress levels to connect.<br><br><br><br> (Sumber: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article)",

        "text": "The next few decades will see great changes in the way energy is supplied <br> and used. In some major oil producing nations, 'peak oil' has already been <br> reached, and there are increasing fears of global warming. Consequently, many <br> countries are focusing on the switch to a low carbon economy. This transition <br> will lead to major changes in the supply and use of electricity. Firstly, there <br> will be an increase in overall demand, as consumers switch from oil and gas <br> to electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Secondly, there will be an <br> increase in power generation, not only in terms of how much is generated, <br> but also how it is generated, as there is growing electricity generation from <br> renewable sources. There is also likely more electricity generation centres, as <br> households and communities take up the opportunity to install photovoltaic <br> cells and small scale wind turbines. To meet these challenges, countries are <br> investing in Smart Grid technology. This system aims to provide the electricity <br> industry with a better understanding of power generation and demand, and to <br> use this information to create a more efficient power network. <br><br> Smart Grid technology basically involves the application of a computer <br> system to the electricity network thus it will pitch in reducing operational <br> and maintenance costs. Smart Grid technology offers benefits to the consumer too. <br> They will be able to collect real-time information on their energy use for each <br> appliance. Varying tariffs throughout the day will give customers the incentive <br> to use appliances at times when supply greatly exceeds demand, leading to <br> great reductions in bills. For example, they may use their washing machines at <br> night. Smart meters can also be connected to the internet or telephone system, <br> allowing customers to switch appliances on or off remotely. Furthermore, if <br> houses are fitted with the apparatus to generate their own power, appliances <br> can be set to run directly from the on-site power source, and any excess can be <br> sold to the grid. <br><br>With these changes comes a range of challenges. The first involves <br> managing the supply and demand. Sources of renewable energy, such as wind, <br> wave and solar, are notoriously unpredictable, and nuclear power, which is <br> also set to increase as nations switch to alternative energy sources, is inflexible. <br> With oil and gas, it is relatively simple to increase the supply of energy to match <br> the increasing demand during peak times of the day or year. With alternative <br> sources, this is far more difficult, and may lead to blackouts or system collapse. <br> Potential solutions include investigating new and efficient ways to store energy <br> and encouraging consumers to use electricity at off-peak times. <br><br> A second problem is the fact that many renewable power generation <br> sources are located in remote areas, such as windy uplands and coastal regions, <br> where there is currently a lack of electrical infrastructure. New infrastructures <br> therefore must be built. Thankfully, with improved smart technology, this can <br> be done more efficiently by reducing the reinforcement or construction costs.<br><br>Although Smart Technology is still in its infancy, pilot schemes to promote <br> and test it are already underway. Consumers are currently testing the new <br> smart meters which can be used in their homes to manage electricity use. <br> There are also a number of demonstrations being planned to show how the <br> smart technology could practically work, and trials are in place to test the new <br> electrical infrastructure. It is likely that technology will be added in 'layers', <br> starting with 'quick win' methods which will provide initial carbon savings, to be <br> followed by more advanced systems at a later date. Cities are prime candidates <br> for investment into smart energy, due to the high population density and <br> high energy use. It is here where Smart Technology is likely to be promoted <br> first, utilising a range of sustainable power sources, transport solutions and an <br> infrastructure for charging electrically powered vehicles. The infrastructure is <br> already changing fast. By the year 2050, changes in the energy supply will have <br> transformed our homes, our roads and our behaviour. <br><br><br><br> (Sumber: https://www.examenglish.com/)",

        "text": "Bicycles have been around since the early part of the nineteenth century. <br> In 1817 Karl Von Drais invented a walking machine to get around the royal <br> gardens faster. Made entirely of wood, the rider straddled two same-sized, in <br> line wheels, steering with the front wheel and locomoting by pushing against <br> the ground. This steerable hobby horse, which could surpass runners and horse <br> drawn carriages, never became a viable transportation option because of the <br> need for smooth pathways, which were rare at that time. <br><br> A second major effort at self-propelled transportation came when Pierre <br> Michaux invented in 1861 the velocipede ('fast foot') that applied pedals <br> directly to the front wheel. To achieve greater speed with every pedal revolution, <br> designers tried larger and larger front wheels, with some reaching almost two <br> meters in diameter. Despite garnering interest from hobbyists, the velocipede <br> had three major deficiencies as transportation: First, lacking gears, it was difficult <br> to climb even a modest grade; second, because the construction was entirely of <br> wood, with metal tires coming slightly later, the cobblestone roads of the day <br> made for an extremely uncomfortable ride; third, the big front wheel created <br> problems. <br><br> A fresh start and the true beginning of bicycles becoming a popular means <br> of transportation can be traced to around 1886 and the efforts of John Kemp <br> Starley and William Sutton. With equal-sized wheels, tubular steel diamond- <br> shaped frame geometry, and a chain-and-sprocket chain drive to the rear <br> wheel, the 'safety bike' looked much like the modern version. During the late <br> 1890s, bicycles were the worldwide focus of invention and technical innovation, <br> much as biotech engineering and computers are today. We owe many of today's <br> industrial manufacturing processes, designs for bearings, axles, and gearing <br> mechanisms, and the knowledge of lightweight structures, to the explosion of <br> inventions that bicycles produced. <br><br> In the United States, England, and other major nations, patents were <br> awarded at the rate of about 5,000 per year per nation. In one peak year, bicycle- <br> related patents comprised close to one-third of all patent-writing activity. Many <br> of these patents were decades ahead of the technology to manufacture them; <br> for example, suspension systems invented a century ago became viable only <br> with modern-day elastic materials and manufacturing technology. <br><br>The two most important single inventions of this long-ago era were <br> Starley's tension-spooked wheel and John Dunlop's pneumatic tire. The <br> tension-spooked wheel was and is a marvel of lightweight structures; it allows <br> four ounces of spokes, on a wheel weighing a total of three or four pounds, to <br> support a 200-pound rider meanwhile today's carbon fiber wheels have yet to <br> show a clear advantage over the wheel made from humble carbon steel spokes. <br> The pneumatic tire, which Dunlop invented in 1888, vastly improved the bike's <br> comfort, and it also shielded the lightweight working mechanisms from excess <br> vibration and fatigue. The coaster brake appeared in 1889, and it has been a <br> staple of children's bikes ever since. <br><br> Because a bicycle uses a low-power engine (the rider) and because that <br> rider can only apply power only over a small rpm range, gearing is essential <br> to match the rider's output to the riding conditions. The first patent for bicycle <br> gears was granted in France in 1868; the rider pedaled forward for one gear and <br> backward for the other gear. An 1869 patent by France's Barberon and Meunier <br> foresaw today's derailleurs. It described a mechanism that would shift a belt <br> or chain sideways among three sprockets or discs. That same year, Barberon <br> and Meunier also patented a primitive gear hub. These technical innovations <br> dramatically improved performance. Bicycles of that era were hand-made in <br> cottage industries, and were highly sought after and expensive. <br><br><br> <br> (Sumber: https: //www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/technology/technology terms-and-concepts/bicycle)",

        "text": "Humans are uniquely smart among all the other species on the planet. <br> We are capable of outstanding feats of technology and engineering. Then why <br> are we so prone to making mistakes? And why do we tend to make the same <br> ones time and time again? When Primate Psychologist Laurie Santos from the <br> Comparative Cognition Lab at Yale University posed this question to her team, <br> they were thinking in particular of the errors of judgement which led to the <br> recent collapse of the financial markets. Santos came to two possible answers <br> to this question. Either humans have designed environments which are too <br> complex for us to fully understand, or we are biologically prone to making bad <br> decisions.  <br> <br> <br> In order to test these theories, the team selected a group of Brown Capuchin <br> monkeys. Monkeys were selected for the test because, as distant relatives of <br> humans, they are intelligent and have the capacity to learn. However, they are <br> not influenced by any of the technological or cultural environments which <br> affect human decision-making. The team wanted to test whether the capuchin <br> monkeys, when put into similar situations as humans, would make the same <br> mistakes. <br> <br> <br> Of particular interest to the scientists was whether monkeys would make <br> the same mistakes when making financial decisions. In order to find out, they <br> had to introduce the monkeys to money. The team distributed metal discs to <br> the monkeys, and taught them that the discs could be exchanged with team- <br> members for food. The monkeys soon cottoned on, and as well as learning <br> simple exchange techniques, were soon able to distinguish 'bargains' – If one <br> team-member offered two grapes in exchange for a metal disc and another <br> team-member offered one grape, the monkeys chose the two-grape option. <br> Interestingly, when the data about the monkey's purchasing strategies was <br> compared with economist's data on human behaviour, there was a perfect <br> match. <br> <br> <br> So, after establishing that the monkey market was operating effectively, <br> the team decided to introduce some problems which humans generally get <br> wrong. One of these issues is risk-taking. Imagine that someone gave you <br> $1000. In addition to this $1000, you can receive either A) an additional $500 or <br> B) someone tosses a coin and if it lands 'heads' you receive an additional $1000, <br> but if it lands 'tails' you receive no more money. Of these options, most people <br> tend to choose option A. They prefer guaranteed earnings, rather than running <br> the risk of receiving nothing. Now imagine a second situation in which you are <br> given $2000. Now, you can choose to either A) lose $500, leaving you with a <br> total of $1500, or B) toss a coin; if it lands 'heads' you lose nothing, but if it lands <br> 'tails' you lose $1000, leaving you with only $1000. Interestingly, when we stand <br> to lose money, we tend to choose the riskier choice, option B. And as we know <br> from the experience of financial investors and gamblers, it is unwise to take risks <br> when we are on a losing streak.  <br> <br> <br> So, would the monkeys make the same basic error of judgement? The team <br> put them to the test by giving them similar options. In the first test, monkeys <br> had the option of exchanging their disc for one grape and receiving one bonus <br> grape, or exchanging the disc for one grape and sometimes receiving two <br> bonus grapes and sometimes receiving no bonus. It turned out that monkeys, <br> like humans, chose the less risky option in times of plenty. Then the experiment <br> was reversed. Monkeys were offered three grapes, but in option A were only <br> actually given two grapes. In option B, they had a fifty-fifty chance of receiving <br> all three grapes or one grape only. The results were that monkeys, like humans, <br> take more risks in times of loss. <br> <br> <br> The implications of this experiment are that because monkeys make the <br> same irrational judgements that humans do, maybe human error is not a result of <br> the complexity of our financial institutions, but is imbedded in our evolutionary <br> history. If this is the case, our errors of judgement will be very difficult to <br> overcome. On a more optimistic note, however, humans are fully capable of <br> overcoming limitations once we have identified them. By recognising them, we <br> can design technologies which will help us to make better choices in future. <br> <br><br><br> <br> (Sumber: https://www.examenglish.com/)        ",

        "text": "Robert Capa is a name that has for many years been synonymous with <br> war photography. Born in Hungary in 1913 as Friedmann Endre Erno, Capa was <br> forced to leave his native country after his involvement in anti government <br> protests. Capa had originally wanted to become a writer, but after his arrival in <br> Berlin had first found work as a photographer. He later left Germany and moved <br> to France due to the rise in Nazism. He tried to find work as a freelance journalist <br> and it was here that he changed his name to Robert Capa, mainly because he <br> thought it would sound more American. <br> <br> <br> In 1936, after the breakout of the Spanish Civil war, Capa went to Spain <br> and it was here over the next three years that he built his reputation as a war <br> photographer. It was here too in 1936 that he took one of his most famous <br> pictures, The Death of a Loyalist Soldier. One of Capa's most famous quotes was <br> 'If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.' And he took <br> his attitude of getting close to the action to an extreme. His photograph, The <br> Death of a Loyalist Soldier is a prime example of this as Capa captures the very <br> moment the soldier falls. However, many have questioned the authenticity of <br> this photograph, claiming that it was staged. <br> <br> <br> When World War II broke out, Capa was in New York, but he was soon back <br> in Europe covering the war for Life magazine. Some of his most famous work <br> was created on 6th June 1944 when he swam ashore with the first assault on <br> Omaha Beach in the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Capa, armed only with two <br> cameras, took more than one hundred photographs in the first hour of the <br> landing, but a mistake in the darkroom during the drying of the film destroyed <br> all but eight frames. It was the images from these frames however that inspired <br> the visual style of Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning movie 'Saving Private Ryan'. <br> When Life magazine published the photographs, they professed that they were <br> slightly out of focus, and Capa later used this as the title of his autobiographical <br> account of the war. <br> <br> <br> In 1947 Capa was among a group of photojournalists who founded Magnum <br> Photos. This was a co-operative organisation set up to support photographers <br> and help them to retain ownership of the copyright to their work. Capa went on <br> to document many other wars. He never attempted to glamorise war though, <br> but to record the horror. He once said, 'The desire of any war photographer is <br> to be put out of business.' Capa died as he had lived. After promising not to <br> photograph any more wars, he accepted an assignment to go to Indochina to <br> cover the first Indochina war. On May 25th 1954 Capa was accompanying a <br> French regiment when he left his jeep to take some photographs of the advance <br> and stepped on a land mine. He was taken to a nearby hospital, still clutching <br> his camera, but was pronounced dead on arrival. He left behind him a testament <br> to the horrors of war and a standard for photojournalism that few others have <br> been able to reach.  <br> <br> <br> Capa's legacy has lived on though and in 1966 his brother Cornell <br> founded the International Fund for Concerned Photography in his honor. <br>  There is also a Robert Capa Gold Medal, which is given to the photographer <br> who publishes the best photographic reporting from abroad with evidence of <br> exceptional courage. But perhaps his greatest legacy of all are the haunting <br> images of the human struggles that he captured. <br> <br><br><br> <br> (Sumber: https://www.examenglish.com/)",
